### Features of FuseWP Lite

FuseWP [subscribes WordPress users after registration to your email list based on their user roles](https://fusewp.com/article/sync-wordpress-users-email-list-based-on-user-roles/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion). If users update their profile information or change their account email address, their profile changes are automatically synchronized to your email marketing software and CRM. And if users' accounts are deleted, they are automatically unsubscribed.

### Powerful Premium Features

Extend FuseWP with the following powerful premium features.

= Double Opt-in Control =

For integrations that support it, you can enable and disable Double Opt-in – requiring users to confirm their subscription to your email list, contact list, or audience before they are subscribed.

= Custom Field Mapping =

Map user profile information to custom fields or attributes in your email marketing integration.

= Integration with Ecommerce & Membership Plugins =

FuseWP integrates with membership and ecommerce plugins to sync users and members to your email marketing list in Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, Constant Contact, Campaign Monitor etc.

Say a user's membership or subscription status changes from Active to Cancelled; they will be removed from the Active email list and added to that of Cancelled.

**– WooCommerce Subscriptions –**

[Sync customers in WooCommerce Subscriptions with your CRM contact list or email marketing list](https://fusewp.com/article/sync-woocommerce-subscriptions-email-marketing/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) based on the subscription product they subscribe to as well as their subscription status. And if a user's subscription status changes, they will be moved to the corresponding email list.

**– WooCommerce Memberships –**

[Sync members in WooCommerce Memberships with your email list](https://fusewp.com/article/sync-woocommerce-memberships-email-marketing/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) based on the membership plans they subscribe to as well as their membership status.
